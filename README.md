# Quizizz anti cheat script

Student can cheat the quizizz! There are chrome plugin and script to get the correct answer of a quiz in quizizz, kahoot, etc (see https://schoolcheats.net/).

What I can do as a teacher/lecturer is to do manual grading. Usually after I make a quiz (in quizizz) with the correct answer, I copy it and change the answer to the wrong one (to get the name of student who cheat) or I can make all the questions into checkbox and select all choices as the correct answer. After that I give the student this quiz with wrong answer and do manual correction.

To make the work easier, I make this little script in python to do the grading.

Before executing this code, I need to prepare 2 output file from quizizz (Excel file). The first excel file is the student answer in quizizz, and the second file is the output from me do the quiz with the correct answer.
